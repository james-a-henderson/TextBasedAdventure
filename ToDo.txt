Immediate Future:

Add proper deconstructors for the various objects (mostly to learn how to do it)



Soonish:

Possibly make it so that input is processed by the player's items and current room



Eventually:

Add saving

Create a basic game to show off everything


Maybe:

Move processInput to the main method (Doesn't make a huge difference either way)
